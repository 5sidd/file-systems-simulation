The history of boxing can be traced back to ancient times. It is believed that boxing originated in ancient Egypt around 3000 BC,
where it was depicted in hieroglyphics. The sport gained popularity in ancient Greece, where it was included in the Olympic Games
as early as 688 BC. Boxing was also practiced in ancient Rome, although it was often a brutal and deadly form of combat.
Throughout the Middle Ages, boxing continued to evolve and was often associated with bare-knuckle fighting. It wasn't until the 18th
century that boxing began to be regulated and rules were established. The Marquess of Queensberry rules, introduced in the 19th century,
laid the foundation for modern-day boxing, including the use of gloves and weight classes. Since then, boxing has become a widely
recognized sport and has produced legendary fighters such as Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson, and Manny Pacquiao.
Today, boxing is governed by various boxing organizations and continues to captivate audiences around the world.
