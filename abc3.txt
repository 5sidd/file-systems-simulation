Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) traces its roots back to ancient civilizations, where various forms of hand-to-hand combat were practiced.
One of the earliest documented instances of MMA-like fighting can be found in ancient Greece, where the sport of Pankration emerged.
Pankration encompassed a combination of striking and grappling techniques and was considered one of the most brutal sports of its time.
Fast forward to the late 19th century, and the sport of catch wrestling gained popularity, showcasing a mix of wrestling and
submission holds. It was during the 20th century that MMA started to take shape in its modern form.
In Brazil, the Gracie family developed Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, a martial art that heavily emphasized ground fighting and submissions.
This laid the foundation for what would eventually become the sport of MMA. The term "mixed martial arts" was coined in the 1990s,
when the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) was established as a platform for fighters from different disciplines to compete.
